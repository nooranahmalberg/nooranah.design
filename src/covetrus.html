        <h1>Minimising risk to safety for veterinarians</h1>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          I joined Covetrus in 2023. My first task as a UX designer on the
          product team was to design the second most requested feature on Pendo:
          more obvious patient medical and behavioural alerts for veterinary
          staff.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          When I dug into this problem, I realised that veterinarians were
          facing multiple issues because of the lack of prominence of these
          alerts. The most significant problem was that staff were missing the
          patient’s behavioural status on the system and getting hurt in
          appointments. The second problem was that multiple patients with
          behavioural issues were being booked in for a visit at the same time,
          which could pose a risk to everyone’s safety and caused disruptions in
          the clinic.
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          We interviewed a total of 4 veterinary staff regarding their usage and
          thoughts on behavioural alerts as implemented on both Ascend
          (cloud-based) and RxWorks (server-based). 2 interviews occurred during
          my clinic visits while the other 2 were done remotely.
        </p>
        <h2>Veterinarians are busy</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to research, it’s typically recommended to aim for 5-6
          participants per user group but veterinary staff are quite busy people
          as they manage demands of a clinic. I made a Loom video to collect
          feedback on designs or consent for an interview from 11 users who
          voted on the Pendo request, but received no views. (If you have any
          little tidbit on what to do instead, I’d love to know!)
        </p>
        <h2>Identifying key points in their workflow</h2>
        <p>
          Clinic visits were particularly helpful in illuminating how the
          software was used to communicate with staff across the clinic. A
          receptionist checking in a patient would use Ascend to send notes to a
          veterinarian awaiting their next patient in a treatment room. On the
          platform, I identified each area in the main workflow where the
          patient’s behaviour status could be more obvious: Client check-in,
          outpatients board, inpatients board and patient details page.
        </p>
        <h2>One customer's impact on scope</h2>
        <p>
          Well, that was the plan until we received an impassioned email from a
          customer. They were one straw away from switching over to another
          practice management system because two “aggressive” patients had
          arrived at their clinic at the same time. This problem was echoed in
          past interview sessions and their pain struck a chord in our hearts. I
          expanded my scope to include the areas where receptionists would book
          in patients: Appointments calendar and booking flow.
        </p>
        <h2>Tons of information at a glance</h2>
        <p>
          After a bit of exploration, the senior designer and I landed on an
          idea that would deliver a ton of detail in a compact form. One key
          insight from all interviews was that behaviour notes were crucial in
          giving more context around a patient’s behaviour status. For example,
          a “care required” dog may only be sensitive to other dogs and not
          affected by people. This is why the alerts chips try to display as
          much of that information at a glance. Since the findability of the
          alerts and notes was low before, I brought it up to the top of the
          page and incorporated it with the patient header component. Using
          colour, iconography and copy to flag for the user’s attention.
        </p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          I shared designs with Covetrus team members who have veterinary
          experience as well as customers. Overall, the final designs tested
          favourably among them. Since my time at Covetrus was brief, I can’t
          share any ongoing metrics on how the solution is performing. But if I
          could, the usage of the behaviour status field would be an excellent
          measure since a large percentage of patients are currently “not
          assessed”. A rise in patients being labelled with a behaviour status
          may indicate that the alerts are more prominent.
