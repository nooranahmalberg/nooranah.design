title: Transitions and Growth
---
**Life is in the Transitions summary:**
Life disruptors, big and small, occur more often now than ever before. These include break ups, career changes or life-changing health diagnoses. 

We tend to like linear narratives but that is rarely how life unfolds. 
We live **half** of our lives in transitions.
People typically experience 3 'lifequakes' and more so now than ever, we're facing more disruptions that redirect the course of our lives. 

Many great achievements have happened after a pivot or turning point in that artists, scientists, entrepreneur's life etc

Transitions typically look like this: 
**Long goodbye —> Messy middles —> New beginnings**

**Bruce Feiler's research identified these universal phases of transitions (which are not linear and neither is each step mandatory for mastering change):**
- Accept the past and identify emotions (long goodbye)
- Mark growth and ritualise it (long goodbye)
	- Markers that remind us that we are no longer that person
- Shed it and discard old narratives (messy middle)
- Create and try new things (messy middle)
	- Creation is the essence of humanity
	- In creating things, we recreate ourselves
- Share it and seek wisdom from others (new beginnings)
	- Connections are important when going through a transition for emotional support and guidance.
	- Most of us want to be comforted.
	- There are 5 ways that people offer feedback:
		- Comforting
		- Nudging
		- The slap
		- The detractor
		- 
- Launch your new self (new beginnings)

### So what?
- Coping with transitions is an important skill in today's increasingly uncertain times.
- Transitions don't happen overnight. It typically lasts 5 years to move on through a long goodbye and reach new beginnings. And yes, the middle is often messy. 
- There is no speed running it but opening up to the process of change might help.
- The non-linear phases of recreating our very selves look a bit like this according to Bruce Feiler:
	- Accepting the past and identify emotions
	- Ritualise changes, remembering who we once were as a marker of our growth.
	- Try new things and rediscover our creative selves.
	- Share your story because that opens us up to connection.
