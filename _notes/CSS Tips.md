## Relative units

- Percentages
  - containers, images
  - setting max widths
- Em units
  - relative to the default font size
  - pixels are not scalable
  - em units on margin is based on the parent or that element's font size
  - can be used on similar properties like gap too
  - proportional scaling; based on element's font size
- Rem units
  - Always scales to the value of the root font size
  - no compounding; more predictable

## Display style

- Images have a default value of inline by default. So they block display needs to be added manually
