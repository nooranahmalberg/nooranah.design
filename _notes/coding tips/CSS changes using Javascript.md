title: CSS changes using Javascript
---
I can use element.style to change an element's style properties through the JS file.

```
element.style.property =  "css-rule"
```

where .property selects a css property and "css-rule" is a property value

The property value in JS must be in camel case if it's hyphenated in css  
e.g. backgroundColor for background-colour
