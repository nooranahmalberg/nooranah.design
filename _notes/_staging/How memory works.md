title: How memory works
---
Memory is ==a complex biological process that involves learning, storing, and retrieving information==. It's made possible by connections between neurons in the brain called synapses. 

**Stages of memory** 
1. **Encoding**: The brain perceives and learns events.
2. **Storage**: The brain maintains information over time.
3. **Retrieval**: The brain accesses stored information.

**Types of memory**
- **Sensory memory**: Stores information from the senses for a short time. 
- **Short-term memory**: Also known as active memory, this is where the brain stores information that is currently being thought about. 
- **Long-term memory**: This is where the mind stores information completely and indefinitely. 

**Factors affecting memory**
- **Frequency of exposure**: The more we practice an activity, the stronger the connections. 
- **Emotional events**: The amygdala is activated by emotional events, which can boost memory encoding and retention. 
- **Distinctiveness**: Unusual events are recalled and recognized better than uniform events.

The main types of memory are ==sensory memory, short-term memory, working memory, and long-term memory==.

## Sensory memory 
- A brief memory that records information from the senses, such as sight, smell, and touch
- A large amount of information is stored for a short time
- Not consciously controlled

## Short-term memory 
- A temporary storage space that holds a limited amount of information for a few seconds to minutes
- Easily accessible
- Examples include remembering a phone number or a string of words

## Working memory 
- The shortest type of memory, lasting just seconds
- Used to hold information in the head while doing other tasks
- A good predictor of general intelligence

## Long-term memory
- A mostly permanent storage space that can hold information for years or even a lifetime 
- Can be further categorized as implicit (unconscious) or explicit (conscious) 
- Examples include semantic memory and episodic memory 

## Semantic memory 
- A type of long-term memory that stores knowledge about the world
- Includes knowing faces, objects, and meanings

## Episodic memory 
- A type of long-term memory that stores memories of specific events
- Includes remembering what happened, where, and when
