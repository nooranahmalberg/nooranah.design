## Learning in the open

I publish some writing on the off-chance that it may spark thoughts or creative connections in your mind too.

You can see where I'm at with that topic as well. Notes will evolve and mature with new learning or connections.

The aim isn't for me to publish perfect notes here. Once it articulates my understanding in my own words, it goes live.
