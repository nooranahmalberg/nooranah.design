title: Impact-driven design

Still refining my approach. This incorporates some of what I learnt about experimentation at Enrola.

These steps are not strictly linear. They are chained and inter-linked.

1. **What's the problem that needs to be solved?**
	- 5 whys
	- Interviewing users or SMEs
	- Heuristics analysis
	- "It sucks that" to articulate the problem
2. **What are the key drivers and anxieties of users?**
	- Interviews and listening sessions
	- Open-ended surveys; intercept survey
3. **How can this be solved?**
	- HMWs
	- Crazy 8s
	- How have others solved a similar problem?
	- Co-design
4. **Is the solution going to deliver the predicted outcome?**
	- Share work and discuss
	- Split testing
5. **How did that solution go?**
