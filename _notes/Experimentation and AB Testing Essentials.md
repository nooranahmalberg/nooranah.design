title: A/B Testing Essentials
---
Why A/B test? Validate business decisions? Sure. It's really about growing your learning through experimentation. In UX terms, this is called [[validated learning]].

AI is becoming better at doing simple A/B tests.

Essential questions before considering implementing any A/B test:
### 1. Do I have enough data?
1,000 and more conversions a month is needed to get meaningful results from an A/B test. 

Not everything should be A/B tested and the amount of data is a huge reason for skipping the test, and focusing effort on taking a risk instead.

### 2. Do I know what I'd like to learn?
- Hypothesis

### 3. What results am I expecting?
- 

## Best practices for A/B testing
- Conducting multiple tests is alright, but keep in mind how they are related to each other.

## How I designed with experimentation in mind at Enrola
I'm early in my data-driven design journey. Through mistakes and refining the process over 6 months at an early stage start up, I landed on this order of steps to help set yourself up for success:
1. Consider the amount of conversions at that step over the last few months
2. Pinpoint the desired effect/behaviour you want
3. Explore the ways that can be achieved
4. Prioritise idea by impact and effort
5. Align on the hypothesis early

Working at an early stage startup, I got to learn how A/B testing isn't always the answer.

## Misconceptions when interpreting A/B Test Results
The A/B test results are not the same
