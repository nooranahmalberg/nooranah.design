## Beef Bahn Mi

**Bahn Mi Factory** in Newstead has the best grilled beef I've tasted in my life. The beef is seared, charred and tossed on a grill, resulting in the perfect amount of chews and flavour. None of those steamed beef slices in these buns. My partner and I often opt for the grilled beef in a rice noodle bowl too. Whatever medium it's served in, I rate their grilled beef highly.

(I have nothing against steamed beef slices by the way, though I do prefer them in a bowl of pho)
## Chicken Bahn Mi

**Bahn Mi Hub** in Wynnum West serves a delicious, saucy and rich lemongrass chicken bahn mi.

**Porkies** in Fortitude Valley/Newstead.

## Tofu/Vegan Bahn Mi

**Fat Carrot** in West End is a favourite inner city spot for catch ups with my friends and to be fair, the meaty alternatives are well worth it too. But it's not often that I get to have a solid vegan sandwich that lowkey takes me back to my time in Vietnam when I was strictly vegeterian. Fresh, crispy and delicious bundles of joy that you can enjoy with a freshly made juice.

> Fancy a Pork Bahn Mi? My partner and his family rate the crackling pork bahn mi from Bahn Mee in Hamilton.
