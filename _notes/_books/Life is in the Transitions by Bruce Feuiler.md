## Summary

> [!abstract] Summary
> Life disruptors, big and small, occur more often now than ever before. These include break ups, career changes or life-changing health diagnoses. Feiler collected and analyzed life stories from 225 people, covering diverse backgrounds and experiences. Through this, he found that people go through **three to five major transitions** in their lifetime, with each lasting about **four to five years**—adding up to nearly half of adult life.
> 
> We tend to like linear narratives but that is rarely how life unfolds.  He identified seven phases that most people move through during transitions: 
> - **The Long Goodbye:** Experiencing pain, shedding old identities
> - **The Messy Middle**: Navigating uncertainty, experimenting, and seeking meaning
> - **The New Beginning:** Embracing change, finding fresh narratives, and adjusting to a new reality

## Thesis

> [!question] What are the main points of the book?
> 
> Resillience is about learning how to move through transitions effectively. It requires an acceptance of the past. People who successfully move forward often say things like "I didn’t choose this, but I can choose how I respond to it."
>  
>  Self-compassion, experimentation and creativity help us through the messy middle. Rituals or markers of the past help us remember what we've been through. 
>  
>  There is no perfect ending or resolution in life. Transitions are messy, iterative and an ongoing process. The new beginning will unlikely be what we expect it to look like.
> 
> Storytelling is at the heart of change. Writing can help us reframe our anxieties into hope. It allows for emotional distance, turning raw emotions into clarity.
> 
> Telling our srtories is an excercise of connecting the dots of our memories. It's through this process of meaning-making where we unlock our future selves and shift our narratives. It shaoes how we view ourselves and lets us move forward and find a home in a new identity.
