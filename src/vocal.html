        <h1>Support for creators</h1>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          While I was a designer at Thinkmill, my colleagues and I formed a
          cross-functional team to help Vocal scale their business in 2022.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          With the ability to earn money by reads and partake in writing
          challenges, Vocal attracted many avid writers upon launch. But since
          writers were the primary users of the platform, growing a readership
          among other writers was a challenge for many Vocal users.
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          We published a survey to collect attitudes towards creator support
          features on Vocal. Once surveys were analysed, 12 focus group sessions
          were conducted where the Design Lead tested several ideas to see what
          kinds of creator experiences users were gravitating. I helped with
          forming the discussion guide, note-taking the sessions and synthesing
          our findings in a visual chart.<br /><br />
          Most of the ideas we tested centred around increasing engagement
          between writers and readers, boosting content and offering exclusive
          perks to VIP readers. I sourced the ideas we tested from other apps,
          user submitted feedback on Vocal and tossed in a few of our team's
          ideas too.
        </p>
        <h2>Reader representation</h2>
        <p>
          Since it was a challenge to find readers of the app from the survey,
          writers who posted 2 or less stories were our closest representatives
          for that target group. We found that most creators on Vocal were keen
          to progress their writing skills and publish more stories so
          understanding readers on Vocal is certainly an area left unexplored.
        </p>
        <h2>Pledge to Support</h2>
        <p>
          The ability to receive tips on an ongoing basis from supporters tested
          really well among participants. With per read, one of the key draws of
          Vocal is the ability for writer's to focus more on writing and less on
          sharing their writing. Thispay feature fit in naturally with Vocal's
          offerings to help creators focus on their craft. I helped design the
          new creator profile pages using the Vocal Design System.
        </p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>I would have measured usage of the pledge support feature.</p>
