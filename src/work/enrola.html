        <h1>How I boosted student enrolments by up to 15%</h1>
        <p>
          At Enrola, I enhanced the conversion rate and usability of their
          digital education comparison and got a taste of experimentatation-led
          design with a small dedicated team at an early-stage startup.
        </p>
        <h2>It sucked that...</h2>
        <p>
          Enroal was facing a high proportion of unqualified leads, which slowed
          down enrolment processes in late 2024. 1 in 4 prospective students
          were applying to the wrong courses. And if they did apply to the right
          course, students often missed key practical course details. This
          slowed down student enrolments and meant less time was spent on
          connecting serious prospective students with a training provider.
        </p>
        <h2>Identifying the problems</h2>
        <p>
          First, I identified scannability and visual hierarchy issues by going
          through the flow and putting myselves in the shoes of a prospective
          student. This exercise was helpful to get an idea of what some
          frustrations are intuitively. I then ran a rough analysis of AI chat
          records and gathered from team members the top information that
          students were clearly missing, and what they should know before
          deciding on the right vocational training partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final design, I leveraged previous A/B tests my team members
          ran and combined it with the new learnings in a full flow redesign. I
          prioritised the key information that students needed to know and
          introduced a new row to connect the results screen with the course
          advisor quiz. The results? A boost in enrolments by up to 15% and a
          significant drop in students that were applying to the wrong courses.
        </p>
        <h2>A page-by-page approach to design</h2>
        <h3>Based on key conversion metrics</h3>
        <li>Student complete quiz and receive course recommendations</li>
        <li>They apply to enrol from comparison view</li>
        <li>They view course details and apply</li>
        <p>
          On the comparison page, I leveraged previous A/B tests my team members
          ran and combined it with the new learnings in a full flow redesign. I
          prioritised the key information that students needed to know and
          introduced a new row to connect the results screen with the course
          advisor quiz. The results? A boost in enrolments by up to 15% across
          every test and a significant drop in students that were applying to
          the wrong courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I’d follow this up with if I could: Because the comparison
          results were not bound to quiz answers and also showed a non-matching
          option, I’d run an intercept survey to measure their attitudes towards
          the results. This would be particularly helpful for users bounced at
          that point in the app to understand why they did not proceed within
          the context of their online education research journey.
        </p>
        <h2>Growing inconsistencies</h2>
        <p>
          The caveat of shipping app designs page-by-page was that, while it
          sped up the design process, minor inconsistencies often cropped up.
          While we did use Bootstrap to maintain some cohesion, the visual
          direction was not clearly defined at the start. This led to a delivery
          of UI kit that addressed the inconsistencies with a holistic update of
          visual design choices.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflections and takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          I think one major takeaway from this project was that designing solo
          truly requires forethought on all aspects of design. I wish I asked
          more foundational questions early on about visual direction and
          tackled the designs more holistically at the start. Particularly for
          an early-stage startup, visual cohesion and direction is important to
          differentiate from competiors and build trust as a new business.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a newbie at conversion rate optimisation, I also was way too
          obsessed with looking for the silver bullet of an idea on Built for
          Mars, Substack and Mobbin's ABtesting. Referring to other products is
          an excellent way to get an idea of what works or even what's being
          tested. But it's also important to remember that every product is
          unique to their users and their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing with the underlying data structure in mind helped save time
          when it came to design and implementation. It was useful to have the
          back-end content console as a reference point to ensure that the
          design was in line structurally.
