title: My first note

### Hello online beings

This is where I explore my ideas and share them publicly so others can read and provide feedback to help me [[Improve my thinking by writing|improve my thinking]].

This garden is in its infancy, so you may see the odd thing floating around sometimes.

The following content on this page is for my use only as I experiment with how this digital garden works.

### Media embedding

You may embed media files within a note using HTML5 media tags. Here's an example for an audio file:

"Jazzy Frenchy" by Benjamin Tissot from bensound.com
<audio controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jazzyfrenchy.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

### Site configuration

Some behavior is configurable by tweaking the `_config.yml` file.

**`use_html_extension`**: if you use a static host that doesn't support URLs that don't end with `.html` (such as Neocities), try changing the `use_html_extension` value to `true` in the `_config.yml` file and restart the Jekyll server (or re-build the site). This adds a `.html` extension to note URLs and may resolve issues with links. If you're still having trouble, I recommend using Netlify to host your digital garden: it's free, easy to use, and fully supports this template's features out of the box.

**`open_external_links_in_new_tab`**: when set to `true`, this makes external links open in new tabs. Set to `false` to open all links in the current tab.

**`embed_tweets`**: when set to `true`, tweet URLs on their own lines will be replaced with a Twitter embed. Default value is `false`.

### Automatic bi-directional links

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

### Link previews

If you're on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes: [[a note about cats]].

Links that have been previewed will be cached to avoid redundant requests.

### Images and other Markdown goodies

Finally, because you have the full power of Markdown in this template, you can use regular Markdown syntax for various formatting options.

Lists work as expected:

- List element A
- List element B
- List element C

1. List element
2. List element
3. List element

If you'd like to quote other people, consider using quote blocks:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

And of course, images look great:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image.jpg"/>

You can also ==highlight some content== by wrapping it with `==`.

Non-latin languages are supported too: ==你好==, ==안녕하세요==, ==こんにちは==.

### Code syntax highlighting

You can add code blocks with full syntax color highlighting by wrapping code snippet in triple backticks and specifying the type of the code (`js`, `rb`, `sh`, etc.):

```js
// Here's a bit of JavaScript:
if (a === b || c == d)
  console.log('hello!')
```

```rb
# And now some Ruby
def foo(bar)
  "baz"
end
```

```sh
$ cat /dev/urandom | grep "the answer to life" # shell scripts look nice too
```
