          <h1>Minimising risk to safety for veterinary staff</h1>
          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>
            In 2023, I was a UX designer at Covetrus. I helped improve the user
            experience of Ascend, their cloud-based veterinarian practice
            management system, based on customer feedback. I worked with a
            product manager, a senior UX designer and front-end engineers to
            meet the needs of veterinary staff surrounding patient alerts.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <img
            alt="Collection of Pendo customer feedback about Behavioural and Medical Alerts"
            src="../images/Covetrus-Pendo.png"
          />
          <p>
            Multiple users expressed that medical and behavioral alerts on the
            practice management system were not obvious enough and their staff
            were unfortunately getting hurt in the process. Understandably so,
            these requests received the second most amount of votes on Pendo by
            other users.
          </p>
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            The Pendo feedback from customers gave us a possible solution but
            did not provide much details into what's going on. To dig deeper
            into why and how these alerts were being missed, I visited 2 clinics
            and interviewed 2 other vet nurses remotely to understand their
            frustrations and needs around patient alerts.

          <h2>The workflow</h2>
          <p>
            From the clinic visits, I determined the points in a typical client
            visit where patient information needed to be more salient.
          </p>
          <h2>Pop-ups were desired but ineffective</h2>
          <p>
            While I got no views on my Loom video, the clinic visits were
            incredibly illuminating. I learnt that the patient pop-ups on
            RxWorks were often hastily dismissed when a vet was focused on
            capturing notes during a consultation. It was clear that pop-ups
            alone would not solve for the lack of prominence of medical and
            behavioural alerts. https://www.nngroup.com/articles/popups/
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the alerts were important information and highly requested,
            they stayed in the final delivery as one of a few alert updates to
            Ascend.
          </p>
          <h2>Veterinarians are busy people</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to testing, it’s typically recommended to aim for 5-6
            participants per user group but veterinary staff are busy people
            with demands of a clinic to manage. 11 users voted for pop-ups on
            Pendo so I made a Loom video to share some ideas and ask for an
            interview. No one viewed my video unfortunately so this tactic
            didn't quite work. If you have any little tidbit on what to do
            instead, I’d love to know!

          <h2>Tons of information at a glance</h2>
          <p>
            Through jamming and design critiques, the Senior UX Designer and I
            landed on an idea that delivered a ton of detail in a compact form.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key insight from user interviews was that the notes attached to
            the patient's behaviour status were crucial in providing more
            context. For example, a “care required” dog may only be sensitive to
            other dogs and not affected by humans. This is why the I tried to
            pack in as much of that information at a glance. Since the
            findability of the alerts and notes was low, alerts were moved to
            the top of the page with the patient's details.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Ascend, I identified each area in the main workflow where the
            patient’s behaviour status could be more obvious from the client
            arriving to their final check out. A receptionist checking in a
            patient would use Ascend to send notes to a veterinarian awaiting
            their next patient in a treatment room.
          </p>
          <h2>One customer's impact on scope</h2>
          <p>
            In the middle of shipping these UX improvements, we received an
            email from a customer who was one straw away from switching to
            another service. They had recently booked two patients with
            behavioural issues to arrive at the same time, causing a lot of
            disruptions to their day. A-ha, calendar bookings. This was
            overlooked so far but thankfully, this email came at the right time.
            Using existing components, I was able to mock up this idea and test
            it with the customer within a week.
          </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The final designs were made with great collaboration with customers
            and they tested well internally, especially among Covetrus team
            members with veterinary experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since my time at Covetrus was brief, I can’t share any ongoing
            metrics on how the solution is performing. But if I could, the usage
            of the behaviour status field would be an interesting measure to
            follow since a large percentage of patients are currently “not
            assessed”. A rise in patients being labelled with a behaviour status
            may indicate that the alerts are more prominent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, awareness of a patient’s behaviour status at any given
            time throughout the main workflow and booking process would be the
            most indicative of success.
