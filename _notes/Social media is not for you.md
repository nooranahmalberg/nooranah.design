title: Social media is not for you

Mel Robbins said that once and it often rings in my head.

## It's for businesses
In 10 arguments to delete your social media accounts right now, Jaron Lanier called social media a "BUMMER" - short for Behaviours of Users Modified and Made into an Empire for Rent.

He's referring to the algorithms which primarily serves the interest of the media company in question. That is keeping us on their platform so we can encounter more ads, selling our information and making our attention"an empire for rent". It's how SportBets can choose to target young men, and how I got targeted with [[Communication Frameworks|communications masterclass]] ads (that class was great btw).

It gets concerning when these private companies align their product with political interests. 
## It's for those looking for you
